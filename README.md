## 1. Bifuraction map  
Consider a system of differential equations that describes some physical quantity,
that for concreteness could represent one of three examples: 1. the position and velocity of an
undamped and frictionless pendulum, 2. a neuron's membrane potential over time, and 3. the average
concentration of a virus in a patient's bloodstream. The differential equations for these examples
include *parameters* that may affect the output of the equations. Changing the pendulum's mass and length
will affect its oscillation frequency, changing the magnitude of injected current into a neuron may transition the
membrane potential from resting to spiking, and the long-term viral load in the bloodstream may
decrease with carefully timed treatments.

## 2. Julia's set
In the context of complex dynamics, a branch of mathematics, the Julia set and the Fatou set are two 
complementary sets (Julia "laces" and Fatou "dusts") defined from a function. Informally, the Fatou 
set of the function consists of values with the property that all nearby values behave similarly under 
repeated iteration of the function, and the Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation 
can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values. Thus the behavior of the function on the Fatou 
set is "regular", while on the Julia set its behavior is "chaotic".

## 3. Scheling's model
Schelling's model of segregation is an agent-based model developed by economist Thomas Schelling. 
Schelling's model does not include outside factors that place pressure on agents to segregate such as 
Jim Crow laws in the United States, but Schelling's work does demonstrate that having people with "mild" 
in-group preference towards their own group could still lead to a highly segregated society via de 
facto segregation. As demonstrated by Rainer Hegselmann, Schelling released his model after Sakoda, 
and in some sense one can see Schellig's model as a particular instanciation of Sakoda's model.
